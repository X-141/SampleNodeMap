This is a documentation on how to create a node map for the 
19DecEvening project. The syntax is simple with a few rules.

Rules:
1. Declare total node count 'N' on first line of text file
2. Nodes are created from indices {0 - (N-1)} basis. 'N' representing the total
nodes of the graph.
3. Nodes are always created first.
4. Linkning nodes requires you to indicate which index the parent
and child nodes are located.

Syntax:
{Index value}:create_node:{Value}
    >Index value can range from {0 - (N-1)}.
    >Value must be a integer value.
    >If a index value is already used, the node will
    not be created.
EX. 1:create_node:45
    >Index value of 1 with a value of 45

{Parent_Node_Index}:link_node:{Child_Node_Index}
    >Parent_Node_Index and Child_Node_Index must be nodes
    That have been created. Results in a error otherwise.
    >Parent_Nodes links to Child_Nodes represents a hierachy.
EX. 1:link_node:2
    >links Parent_Node at index 1 to Child_Node at index 2

Example of NodeMap:
    6
    0:create_node:20
    1:create_node:21
    2:create_node:22
    3:create_node:23
    4:create_node:45
    5:create_node:47
    0:link_node:1
    1:link_node:2
    2:link_node:3
    3:link_node:4
    4:link_node:5
